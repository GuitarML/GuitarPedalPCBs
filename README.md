# GuitarPedalPCBs
Collection of KiCad circuit board designs for guitar pedals you can build yourself.

Currently through-hole designs only, SMT (surface mount) may be added later. Soldering and basic knowledge of components and component values is required.

## Pedals

- Classic Boost (Compare to LPB-1 Electro-Harmonix) - Through hole design - Analog

## How it works
1. Download or clone this repo to get the KiCad design files.
2. Use the PCB manufacturing service of your choice to order the boards. PCBWay, JLCPCB, and OSHPark are popular choices. <br>
   These designs have been tested using OSHPark. Simply go to the homepage and drag and drop the KiCad PCB file to upload and
   follow the prompts, no Gerber files required. 
3. Optionally, purchase a pre-drilled enclosure from Tayda. These designs have a tayda drill template that has been tested with the pcb. 
4. Purchase the components needed as shown in the parts list. Suggested sources are linked in the parts list, popular choices are Tayda, Mouser, Amazon.
5. When you receive your parts, assemble, solder, and wire the pedal.

Note: The pedal wiring works the same as most PedalPCB pedals with a 3PDT footswitch unless otherwise noted. 
      You can use [this build documentation](https://docs.pedalpcb.com/project/Amentum.pdf) as a wiring reference.
